For now we have a [`explore_MRI_images.ipynb`] (https://github.com/SamrawitMM/FDSProject/blob/master/explore_MRI_images.ipynb) to read the images functional and anatomical which are 4dimnetial so let's take it from here to make more preprocessing to make it ready for the model in the sub folders there are meta data let's explore how we can get insights in the meta data there is also a participant.tsv file consisting some info about the participants hopeflly this will give us some hint to move forwared.
