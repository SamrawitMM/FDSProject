For now, we have a [`explore_MRI_images.ipynb`](https://github.com/SamrawitMM/FDSProject/blob/master/explore_MRI_images.ipynb) to read the images functional and anatomical which are 4dimnetial so let's take it from here to make more preprocessing to make it ready for the model. In the subfolders there is metadata let's explore how we can get insights into the metadata there is also a participant.tsv file consisting of some info about the participants Hopefully this will give us some hints to move forward.
